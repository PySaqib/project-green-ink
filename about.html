    <div id="about">

        Project Green Ink was created soon after the event of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum_massacre">Sudan Massacre</a>. I realized that there wasn't much attention and exposure that was being brought to the plight of Middle-Eastern populace. However, the project soon expanded to Pakistan, my home country, as well. As I have been the sole person behind the project, it is difficult to develop these illustrations on a regular basis. However, it still remains an active effort to highlight significant disparities in the society.
